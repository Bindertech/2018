# Invoke-{your}RestMethod

[Nordic Infrastructure Conference 2018](http://nicconf.com/talks/invoke-yourrestmethod/) - conference link

## Talk

Can you work a whole day using one Powershell Cmdlet? We believe you might have to.

No matter the platform, cloud or programming language API’s are the fundamentals in the modern world and many services and solutions can only be configured through them. In this demo-oriented session we will show you how to get started with Powershell and web API’s before we continue to tie together multiple API’s and take action on the data – everything using one Cmdlet, Invoke-RestMethod
